This document describes database configuration using a PostgreSQL and Rails example in the following sections:

## Database Environment Configuration Overview
Postgres is not pre-installed in the base container image (the primary image). All commands are executed from the base image that you declare in the first `image` key in your `.circleci/config.yml` file. The Database `postgres:9.6` image is a service container and no commands are executed in this container. So, it is important to tell postgres to use tcp and to specify `host: localhost` in the `database.yml` configuration. See the Docker section of the [Choosing an Executor Type]({{ site.baseurl }}/2.0/executor-types/#using-docker) document for more details.

In addition, all base images from docker are based on debian stable which uses version 9.4 packages. If you need a newer version of psql, install it from another location, for example, https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/.

**Note:** If you are using the `pq` gem, you should not need to install `psql`. This step is only necessary if you want to run the `psql` command.

The default user, port, and test database for PostgreSQL 9.6 are as follows:

`postgres://ubuntu:@127.0.0.1:5432/circle_test`

**Note:** For version 9.5, the default port is 5433 instead of 5432. To specify a different port, change the `$DATABASE_URL` and all invocations of `psql`.

## Example CircleCI Configuration for a Rails App With structure.sql

If you are migrating a Rails app configured with a `structure.sql` file make
sure that `psql` is installed in your PATH and has the proper permissions, as
follows, because the circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node image does not have psql installed
by default and uses `pg` gem for database access.

```
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/circleci-demo-ruby-rails
    
    # Primary container image where all commands run
    
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node
        environment:
        - RAILS_ENV: test
        - PGHOST: 127.0.0.1
        - PGUSER: root
    
    # Service container image available at `host: localhost`
    
      - image: circleci/postgres:9.6.2-alpine
        environment:
        - POSTGRES_USER: root
        - POSTGRES_DB: circle-test_test
        
    steps:
      - checkout

      # Restore bundle cache
      - restore_cache:
          keys:
            - rails-demo-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
            - rails-demo-

      # Bundle install dependencies
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: bundle check --path=vendor/bundle || bundle install --path=vendor/bundle --jobs 4 --retry 3

      - run: sudo apt install postgresql-client

      # Store bundle cache
      - save_cache:
          key: rails-demo-{{ checksum "Gemfile.lock" }}
          paths:
            - vendor/bundle

      - run:
          name: Database Setup
          command: |
            bundle exec rake db:create
            bundle exec rake db:structure:load

      - run:
          name: Parallel RSpec
          command: bin/rails test

      # Save artifacts
      - store_test_results:
          path: /tmp/test-results
```
{% endraw %}

**Note:** An alternative is to build your own image by extending the current image,
installing the needed packages, committing, and pushing it to Docker Hub or the
registry of your choosing.

### Example Environment Setup

In CircleCI 2.0 you must declare your database configuration explicitly because multiple pre-built or custom images may be in use. For example, Rails will try to use a database URL in the following order:

1.	DATABASE_URL environment variable, if set
2.	The test section configuration for the appropriate environment in your `config.yml` file (usually `test` for your test suite).

The following example demonstrates this order by combining the `environment` setting with the image and by also including the `environment` configuration in the shell command to enable the database connection:

```
version: 2
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: ~/appName
    docker:
      - image: ruby:2.3.1
        environment:
        - PG_HOST=localhost
        - PG_USER=ubuntu
        - RAILS_ENV=test
        - RACK_ENV=test
      # The following example uses the official postgres 9.6 image, you may also use circleci/postgres:9.6 
      # which includes a few enhancements and modifications. It is possible to use either image.
      - image: postgres:9.6
        environment:
        - POSTGRES_USER=ubuntu
        - POSTGRES_DB=db_name
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Ruby Dependencies
          command: bundle install
      - run: 
          name: Set up DB
          command: |
            bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load --trace
            bundle exec rake db:migrate
        environment:
          DATABASE_URL: "postgres://ubuntu@localhost:5432/db_name"
```

## Optional Customization

This section describes additional optional configuration for further customizing your build, login password, and avoiding race conditions.

### Optimizing Postgres Images
The default `circleci/postgres` Docker image uses regular persistent storage on disk.
Using `tmpfs` may make tests run faster and may use fewer resources. To use a variant
leveraging `tmpfs` storage, just append `-ram` to the `circleci/postgres` tag (i.e., 
`circleci/postgres:9.6-alpine-ram`). 

PostGIS is also available and can be combined with the previous example:
`circleci/postgres:9.6-alpine-postgis-ram`

### Using Binaries
To use `pg_dump`, `pg_restore` and similar utilities requires some extra configuration to ensure that `pg_dump` invocations will also use the correct version. Add the following to your `config.yml` file to enable `pg_*` or equivalent database utilities:

```
     steps:
    # Add the Postgres 9.6 binaries to the path.
       - run: echo '/usr/lib/postgresql/9.6/bin/:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV
```

### Configuring Passwordless Login
Use the configuration in this section if you want to use a DB without a password.  

The default PostgreSQL configuration is set up to always ask the user for a password, unless using `sudo`. However, the default user has no password, so you essentially cannot log in without using `sudo`. 

To work around this, you can overwrite the existing user with a new user and a password and create your own database, for example:

    steps:
      - run:
    # Add a password to the `ubuntu` user, since Postgres is configured to
    # always ask for a password without sudo, and fails without one.
        command: sudo -u postgres psql -p 5433 -c "create user ubuntu with password 'ubuntu';"
        command: sudo -u postgres psql -p 5433 -c "alter user ubuntu with superuser;"

    # Create a new test database.
        command: sudo -u postgres psql -p 5433 -c "create database test;"
        
Alternativly, you should not need to do this step if you set the environment variables for the postgresql container as documented here: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

### Using Dockerize

Using multiple Docker containers for your jobs may cause race conditions if the service in a container does not start  before the job tries to use it. For example, your PostgreSQL container might be running, but might not be ready to accept connections. Work around this problem by using `dockerize` to wait for dependencies.
Following is an example of how to do this in your CircleCI `config.yml` file:

```
version: 2.0
jobs:
  build:
    working_directory: /your/workdir
    docker:
      - image: your/image_for_primary_container
      - image: postgres:9.6.2-alpine
        environment:
          POSTGRES_USER: your_postgres_user
          POSTGRES_DB: your_postgres_test
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: install dockerize
          command: wget https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize/releases/download/$DOCKERIZE_VERSION/dockerize-linux-amd64-$DOCKERIZE_VERSION.tar.gz && tar -C /usr/local/bin -xzvf dockerize-linux-amd64-$DOCKERIZE_VERSION.tar.gz && rm dockerize-linux-amd64-$DOCKERIZE_VERSION.tar.gz
          environment:
            DOCKERIZE_VERSION: v0.3.0
      - run:
          name: Wait for db
          command: dockerize -wait tcp://localhost:5432 -timeout 1m
```

It is possible to apply the same principle for the following databases:

- MySQL:

`dockerize -wait tcp://localhost:3306 -timeout 1m`

- Redis:

`dockerize -wait tcp://localhost:6379 -timeout 1m`

Redis also has a CLI available:

`sudo apt-get install redis-tools ; while ! redis-cli ping 2>/dev/null ; do sleep 1 ; done`

- Other services such as web servers:

`dockerize -wait http://localhost:80 -timeout 1m`
